## init npm in backend
root/backend 
- $npm init -y (creates package.json)
- $npm install

## simple npm scritps
npm run watch
npm run dev
npm run prod

## backend install scripts 
- main modules
- npm install express dotenv axios cors pg node-cron nodemailer winston
- (express = web framework for creating api routes)
- (dotenv = loads variables from a .env file)
- (axios = promise-based http client for maknigrequests to external apis)
- (cors = enable cors if frontend is running on different port/domani during dev)
- (pg = using postgresql)
- (node-cron = automatic server tasks)
- (nodemailer = send emails and alerts)
- (windston = structed logging)
- 

- Alerts, logging, and testing oh my
- npm install --save-dev nodemon eslint prettier jest
- (--save-dev = automatically restart server on file changes in dev)
- (eslint + prettier = code formatting)
- (jest = automated testing)


# üõ£Ô∏è Stock Dashboard Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project & Environment Setup
- [x] Set up monorepo/project folders (`backend/`, `frontend/`, root `README`, etc.)
- [x] Initialize Node.js backend with `package.json` and `.env`
- [x] Add Docker/Docker Compose with Postgres (for scalable dev/prod workflow)
- [x] Create base Express app with health check route (e.g., `/api/health`)
- [x] Integrate `dotenv` for config management
- [x] Setup Git and `.gitignore`

---

## Phase 2: API Foundations (Core API Features)
- [x] Finnhub integration utility and basic ‚Äúget stock quote‚Äù endpoint
- [x] Error handling for API calls
- [x] Endpoint: **Get stock details** (e.g., `/api/stock/:symbol`)
- [x] Endpoint: **Get company profile** (e.g., `/api/company/:symbol`)
- [x] Endpoint: **Get historical prices** (optional, e.g., `/api/stock/:symbol/history`)
- [x] Endpoint: **Search stocks** (e.g., `/api/search?q=...`)
- [ ] (Optional) Add caching for popular endpoints (in-memory or Redis)
- [ ] Secure API keys and sensitive data
- [ ] API documentation (e.g., with Swagger/OpenAPI or markdown)

---

## Phase 3: User & Portfolio Features
- [ ] User management: Create/test users (auth can be simple at first, e.g. mock or JWT later)
- [ ] Portfolio endpoints: Add/remove stocks to a user's portfolio
- [ ] Portfolio: Get full user portfolio with live quote enrichment
- [ ] Portfolio: Calculate and return gain/loss, current value, etc.

---

## Phase 4: Database Integration (Postgres)
- [ ] Connect to PostgreSQL using `pg`/`sequelize`/`knex`
- [ ] Design schema: Users, portfolios, transactions, watchlists, etc.
- [ ] Implement models and data access logic
- [ ] Update API endpoints to use database instead of in-memory structures

---

## Phase 5: Advanced API Features & Quality
- [ ] Add rate-limiting and security middleware
- [ ] Add cron jobs for scheduled updates (e.g., daily summary emails, portfolio updates)
- [ ] Implement alerts/notifications (via email or in-app)
- [ ] Unit/integration tests (`Jest` or `Mocha`)
- [ ] Add logging and error monitoring (`winston`, `morgan`, or similar)
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (Docker prod, environment configs, etc.)

---

## Phase 6: Frontend Kickoff (React/Next.js or your stack)
- [ ] Bootstrap frontend with your chosen stack (e.g., Next.js with Tailwind)
- [ ] Connect to backend API: Test endpoints in the UI
- [ ] Build dashboard layout: Sidebar, main content, navigation
- [ ] Display stock info, company data, historical charts
- [ ] User auth and session management
- [ ] Portfolio UI: Add/remove stocks, show value, gain/loss, etc.
- [ ] Alerts/notifications UI

---

## Phase 7: Polish, Deploy, & Monitor
- [ ] CI/CD for both backend and frontend (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- [ ] Deploy to cloud (Railway, Render, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- [ ] Setup monitoring/logging in production
- [ ] Polish UI/UX
- [ ] Prepare for future features (mobile, more APIs, advanced analytics)

---

## Tips
- **Work in small increments:** Tackle one endpoint/feature at a time and test it.
- **Test with tools like Postman or curl before building frontend features.**
- **Keep code modular and write docs as you go.**
- **Use Git branches for major features.**
